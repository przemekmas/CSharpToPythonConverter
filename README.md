# CSharpToPythonConverter

 Very basic C# to Python converter

The C# code allows the user to input C# code that will then be converted into Python code. The user should be able to copy and paste the converted Python code and run it in a Python IDE. The converter is very basic and can be used to convert C# code snippets. At the moment the converter supports the following:

- Classes
- Methods
- Conditions
- For each loop
- For loop
- While loop
- Lists

I will be improving the code converter as much as possible.
